# Overview
The purpose of this file was to experiement with the javascript functionality and gain a better understanding of its uses/become more familiar with a C based programming language.


[JavaScript Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/Nn7whl2fvfo)

# Development Environment
VSCode as my code interpretor to run the HTML and JavaScript code.
Live Server module to provide a easy to use web page that wouldn't require the code to be pushed to github for constant testing.
ChatGPT to generate a list of ingredients and recipes that the javascript code could pull from.

Developed in:
HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

Lodash library: 
simplifys several common programming tasks, can slightly boost performance, and is often used for object manipulation.

# Future Work

- Link the recipe finder to an actual recipe website instead of pulling from a set of predetermined recipes
- The current version is case sensitive to the provided ingredients and limited by a predetermined set of ingredients to each recipe
- The code should ask for quantity of ingredients and keep track of what is left in the the users pantry. 
- The code should provide a list of recipes that the user can create instead of just offering one suggestion. It can also offer an option for additional recipes that have almost all the ingredients but are missing some of the ingredients.
